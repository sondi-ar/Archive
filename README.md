# Artefact
The complete Bill Levy archive: "Suck". Suck was a European pornographic magazine created in the 70s by among others Jim Haynes, William Levy, Heathcote Williams, Germaine Greer, and Jean Shrimpton. The founders of Suck also organised 2 film festivals in Amsterdam titled "The Wet Dream Film Festival (1&2)". 10 of the movies shown during this festival are now stored in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. "Colt und Köcher" is one of them and also the subject of my research.

  "Archive Fever" -Derrida
(http://artsites.ucsc.edu/sdaniel/230/derrida_archivefever.pdf)

> Archiving Is a question of the future [...] of a promise and of a responsibility for tomorrow. If we want to know what this will have meant, we will only know in the times to come.

- There is no beginnings, just traces - To understand this, you must first understand that etc...
- The desire to understand moments of inception (the establishment or starting point of an institution or activity)
- Beginnings and origins, which we think might be some kind of truth - but they leaves spaces to which we/historian makes their own mark
- Nothing starts in an archive, everything is halfway through - discontinuity
- Meaning in both commencement and commandment
- Archive and public vs private space. Who has the right to enter? How to classify? Who chooses?
