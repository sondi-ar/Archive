# Artefact
The complete Bill Levy archive: "Suck". Suck was a European pornographic magazine created in the 70s by among others Jim Haynes, William Levy, Heathcote Williams, Germaine Greer, and Jean Shrimpton. The founders of Suck also organised 2 film festivals in Amsterdam titled "The Wet Dream Film Festival (1&2)". 10 of the movies shown during this festival are now stored in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. "Colt und Köcher" is one of them and also the subject of my research.
