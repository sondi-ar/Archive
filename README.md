## Artefact
The complete Bill Levy archive: "Suck". Suck was a European pornographic magazine created in the 70s by among others Jim Haynes, William Levy, Heathcote Williams, Germaine Greer, and Jean Shrimpton. The founders of Suck also organised 2 film festivals in Amsterdam titled "The Wet Dream Film Festival (1&2)". 10 of the movies shown during this festival are now stored in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. "Colt und Köcher" is one of them and also the subject of my research.

    <summary>Archive Fever</summary>
Derrida - http://artsites.ucsc.edu/sdaniel/230/derrida_archivefever.pdf

> Archiving Is a question of the future [...] of a promise and of a responsibility for tomorrow. If we want to know what this will have meant, we will only know in the times to come.

- There is no beginnings, just traces - To understand this, you must first understand that etc...
- The desire to understand moments of inception (the establishment or starting point of an institution or activity)
- Beginnings and origins, which we think might be some kind of truth - but they leaves spaces to which we/historian makes their own mark
- Nothing starts in an archive, everything is halfway through - discontinuity
- Meaning in both commencement and commandment
- Archive and public vs private space. Who has the right to enter? How to classify? Who chooses?

  > How will both analog and contemporary born-digital (e.g., Internet-based) pornographies be processed given the stigmas and metadata issues surrounding sexually explicit materials in the archives?

  - Archives are unexpectedly political
  - To process porn, one must consume it and risk internalizing the notion that one is a pervert for doing so
  - Analog erotica brings up questions of copyright infringement and privacy rights
  - Providing context and demonstrating the cultural and historical value of the collections” is key for pornography
  - Sex and archives, by convention, seem like opposites: a private experience versus a public institution

### Photo and Video processes
8 mm film is a motion picture film format in which the film strip is eight millimeters wide. It exists in two main versions — the original standard 8 mm film, also known as regular 8 mm, and Super 8. Although both standard 8 mm and Super 8 are 8 mm wide, Super 8 has a larger image area because of its smaller and more widely spaced perforations.

The archive had 2 projectors available. Unfortunately The mechanism of both projectors were broken. It was not possible to watch the movie in its entiry. The only way to watch it was by moving the wheel of the projector manually frame by frame.

### Pornography and Art
#### Andrea Frase "Untitled" & Skin, 2009
we speak of consuming pornography and of appreciating art which indicates that there is a fundamental difference in how we are meant to engage with both kinds of representation, but the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. [1]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/Art1.png" width="30%">   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/Art2.png" width="31.8%">

On the left we see the work of Andrea Fraser "Untitled, 2003". The artist is seen having sex with an unidentified American collector. <br/>
On the right we can see "Skin, 2009", a film showing two figures in nude bodysuits starting to make out. The figures slowly start to cut away parts of their costumes as they grow more aroused. Those are two examples of “Art meets Porn” shown in Museums.

```
How can we define the line between art & pornography?
Can the label of "art" add value to pornography?
Can the label of "art" help transgress the private space and bring pornography into the public sphere?
```

### Pornography and Activism
Pleasure and freedom as a form of protest against dominant power structures.
The digital age has banalised sexuality and therefore affected our representations. We are both the witnesses and the actors of a moving culture where sexuality evolves too, increasingly leading to hypersexualised societies where sexual contents are at our fingertips. Sex is marketable and sexual content usually only reinforce the status quo. [2] <br/> How can Pornography be used as a tool for activism?

#### Fuck For Forest
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/activism.png" width="50%"> <br/>
>"Porn makes really, really a lot of money, so why not use that money for good?"

Fuck for Forest (FFF) is a non-profit environmental organisation founded in 2004 in Norway by Leona Johansson and Tommy Hol Ellingsen. It funds itself through a website of sexually explicit videos and photographs, charging a membership fee for access. They believe in saving the planet by videotaping themselves having sex. The concept here is that the group sells homemade porn on the internet, using the funds to buy up threatened rainforest land.It is the world's first eco-porn organisation and may be the only porn website specifically created to raise money for a cause.

How can Pornography be used as a tool for Activism?
Can Activism give new relevance to porn?
How can Pornography be used as a story telling device?

### Pornography in the Public Sphere

#### Eye Museum
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/public.png" width="40%"> <br/>
An Event that took place in 2015 at the eye museum in Amsterdam. It was a recapitulation of the Wet Dreams Film Festival, 1970/1971 in Amsterdam, by one of its founders: artist and story teller Willem de Ridder.

#### La Fête du Slip
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/public2.png" width="45%"> <br/>
La Fête du Slip is an annual alternative-porn film festival held in Lausanne, Switzerland. It is Romandy's first and biggest multidisciplinary festival whose sole purpose is to focus on body, gender, and sexuality in art.

#### Porn Film Festival Vienna
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/public3.png" width="40%"> <br/>
A showcase and celebrate of the colourful diversity of porn. The goal of this festival is to stimulate an open, societal debate. Its mission is to bring a genre back into the public sphere of the cinema that is usually locked away in private quarters. Its prime directive is to present the creativity and political possibilities of a defining (yet always hidden) part of society. The goal is to challenge prejudices and stereotypes. The festival offers a film and theory program that breaks the monotony boring cheesy mainstream porn – to proudly presents feminist, queer & LGBTIQ* positions. The Porn Film Festival Vienna wants to create an open and welcoming space for reception, discussion, and reflection and to challenge and broaden horizons. Because porn can be: lustful, honest, friendly and self-determined!

## Transcoding
By creating different systems of transcoding, I'm hoping that each way of transcoding will question the value of the pornographic film presented either by adding or deducting value. I want to question our relation to porn and navigate between the line of the private and the public sphere.<br/>

### Reconstructing the Film
#### Description
Colt und Köscher is an 8mm in really bad condition. The movie is cut at many places and only holds with some old transparent tape. While watching it the movie started to rip apart. It might not be possible to watch it on a projector due to that. All i have is a footage of me going trough parts of the video frame by frame.
Without any access to the archive, how can I utilise the footage that I have and make some reconstruction.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/reconstruct.png" width="33%"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sondi-ar/Archive/master/Documentation/img/reconstruct1.png" width="33%"> <img src="Documentation/img/video5.png" width="33%">

#### Aim
The aim of the reconstruction is to understand and see the material in its "original form" and to redistribute it to the public.

#### Methods
- Turn a sequence into individual frames
- Select each frames that show a full frame of the original film
- Put those selected frames together
- Recreate a sequence
- Speed up the video to create movement


#### Tools
The tool used for the reconstruction is Adobe PremierePro

### Recolouring
#### Description
From the informations I have found on the movie and through the cover box, I know that the original film was in colour, but through the effect of time the colours faded. I want to find a way to recolour the film either multiple frames or a whole sequences.

#### Aim
This transcoding is another attempt to give back the "original" look to the film.

#### Methods
Using only photoshop and solid colours as overlay layers, i tested out colours and ways of recolouring

### Mapping the Festival
#### Description
This transcoding is a remapping o fthe festival by gathering as much information as I can on the first Wet Dream Film Festival
#### Aim
In constrast to the pornography we consume on the internet, the pornography in the archive can only be viewed by request and with the right equipments that are not always available. Here a movie that has been made to be consumed for arousal purposes is being locked in a fridge. The aim is to give the movie it's "initial" purpose and to redistribute it to the public along side the dialogue and criticism it tried to explore. To achieve this I created to website that serves as an Archive and map for The Wet Dream Film Festival of 1970.

#### Methods
 I've gathered a multitude of informations from at the archive and compiled them into a website. All the informations found in the website are from Archive. I also researched the visual identity of the festival to recreate its appeal.
